# dlog

Go's standard logger is fairly limited. As result, kazilion alternatives loggers have been written.

All of these are wonderful. They can make your logs look colorful and pretty, format them for ElasticSearch, and more.

Cool, but all I wanted is something super dumb, that just exposes `log.Info()`, `log.Error()` and a couple other standard levels. I don't need a super flexible kitchen sink. Just something super basic and trivial to use.

So, here's one more logging library for Go. The dumbest of them all. Enjoy.
